# Component-Based Tweetbox with Karax

This is a sample app that demonstrates one approach to component-based architecture in [Karax](https://github.com/pragmagic/karax). [Read my post](https://moigagoo.svbtle.com/exploring-karax) to learn more.


## Installation

You'll need Nim 0.19, Nimble, and Karax. Install Nim and Nimble with [choosenim](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim) and Karax with `nimble install karax@#head`.


## Run

To run the app, execute `karun -r src/karaxapp.nim` inside the cloned repo directory.
